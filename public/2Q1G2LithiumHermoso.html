    <h3>Team Overview!!</h3>
    <p>Nekoma also known as "The Cats" is known for their strategic gameplay and strong teamwork. <br>
    The Nekoma High volleyball team based on Tokyo, Japan, specializes in a relentless, strategic defensive playstyle that focuses on maintaining rallies, overwhelming opponents, 
    and setting up for precise, coordinated counter-attacks precision on the court. <br> Instead of relying on height or power, Nekoma excels through coordination, defense, and adaptability, with
    their playstyle focusing on reading the opponent and turning every rally into a battle of endurance and patience. <br>
    The team functions like a body with the likes of Kenma Kozume, their setter, functioning as their brain, dictating the tempo of the match and their captain Tetsuro Kuroo leading the frontline with his intelligent blocks and calm leadership.</p>

            <h2 class="center bbh-sans-bogle-regular">CONNECT</h2>

            <p>
                Their banner,"Connect," defines their philosohpy of playing on the court. They rely on a continous flow of actions between players where each receive, set, and spike is a part of a long connection that cannot be broken.<br>
                Nekoma's strategy revolves around this concept of connection, where every player is attuned to each other's movements and intentions, allowing them to adapt fluidly to the dynamics of the game. <br>
                Every player trusts each other to continue the game no matter how intense the rally gets.
